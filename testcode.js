// 1. On start, load a definition and blanks corresponding to the number 
//of letters in the word that goes with the definition
//
// 2. When the user presses a letter whose value corresponds with a letter found
//in the word, the button disappears, and it is placed in the position where it is 
//found in the word.
//
// 3. When the user presses a letter whose value does not correspond with a 
//letter found in the word, the button disappears and failed atts increases 
//by 1.
// 
//4. When the user has correctly selected all of the letters in the word, 
//"You did it! Press START! for next word" appears in place of the word, 
//and correct words increases by 1.
//
// 5. When failed attempts = 6, the hanged man appears in place of the empty
//gallows, the word is replaced with "Another one bites the dust. Press START! 
//to try again.", and body count increases by 1. (Possibly, the word auto-completes 
//after the 6th failed attempt?)
//
// 6. Win or lose, when the start button is pressed, all removed letters 
//reappear and a new word is loaded up. Go back to start, pass go, collect $200.
// 

//Combining arrays words and defs into a single object instead.
